IPython notebooks developed for the study of the Hebrew Bible.

# Table of notebooks

## Feature Studies
Explorations into the features in the ETCBC text database of the Hebrew Bible.

These notebooks contain descriptions of the meanings of certain features and their values,
and they will show you examples, and they will test assertions about them.
For example: *the ``clause_constituent_relation``-feature has value ``none`` for a node if and only if that node has no outgoing edges labeled ``mother``*.

* [clause_atoms](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ETCBC/study/blob/master/notebooks/feature-studies/clause_atoms.ipynb)
* [tense](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ETCBC/study/blob/master/notebooks/feature-studies/Tense.ipynb)
* [stem](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ETCBC/study/blob/master/notebooks/feature-studies/Stem.ipynb)
* [clause_types](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ETCBC/study/blob/master/notebooks/feature-studies/clause_type.ipynb)

## Syntax
Research to syntactic phenomena in the sentences of the Hebrew Bible.
Correlating morphological features to syntactic functions.
